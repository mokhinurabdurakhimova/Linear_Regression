# Linear_Regression
Data calculation function

Getting Started
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). ... Such models are called linear models.

Documentation
The results are summarized in the pdf-file assignment_1.pdf. A version including the source code used for this can be found in the file assignment_1_source.pdf.

Prerequisites
The main script was developed and tested as a MATLAB live script. A MATLAB version supporting live scripts must be used.

Run scripts
The code can be executed by running the assignment_1.mlx script as a MATLAB live script. Running the entire script may take some time, as explorative analyses for some excercises go through a large number of iterations.
